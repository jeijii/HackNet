    <h3>Learning IT has never been more interactive</h3>
    <p style="max-width:70%;">Here at ITP292-03TEAM3 Studios, we aim to bring our users an enjoyable experience that will keep them coming back for more.</p>
    <h3>Who are we</h3>
    <p style="max-width:70%;">We are indivduals that met at the tertiary level with an idea that connected us all - HackNet.<br />
        We noticed that when you play games, you are more focused at the task at hand compared to studying. If we could combine the two pros of concentrated focus and learning, the advantages would be very valuable.<br />
        With the quote "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." in mind, we all set out on a mission to create something that would be able to benefit others that may not be as IT-savvy as us, but very much deserve to.<br />
        As the world keeps its steady advancement of technology, it is crutial that we help our fellow netizens stay relevant by keeping them updated.
